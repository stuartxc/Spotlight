# Spotlight: My Personal Project
## A fill-in-the-blank game

Play if you dare! Spotlight is a game that encourages 
bullying... **healthy** bullying between friends.

Game instructions:

Each round, one player is assigned to be the judge, and
one player will be in the spotlight. Everyone but the judge
will be given a prompt **regarding** the player in the spotlight
to answer as they please. Once they answer the prompt,
the judge will award a point to the person whose answer
they like the best.

For example:
* Player A, B, C, J, and S are playing a game!
* This round, J is the Judge and S is in the Spotlight.
* A, B, C, and S are given the prompt: "S's most embarassing
memory is..."
* Once A, B, and C, and S have all given their response, J
will award a point to the player whose answer they like
the best.

Players are also free to make prompts that they'd like
to add to the game! These prompts are randomly selected
at the beginning of every round.

This application is for those who love party games like
*Cards Against Humanity*, *Quiplash* from *The Jackbox
Party Packs*, *Apples to Apples*, etc. 

I chose to create this program because I really enjoy playing
the above games, but I felt like they would benefit
from a more personal feel. Because Spotlight focuses
on one person at a time while moving through the group,
there will be plenty of shots fired between friends and 
funny moments to be had.
 

## User Stories
* As a user, I want to be able to add a prompt to the current library of prompts before the game starts.
* As a user, I want to add myself to the list of players before the game starts.
* As a user, I want the non-judge players to be able to input a response to the prompt every round.
* As a user, I want to be able to give a point to the player who wins the round (the judge decides).

* As a user, I want to be able to save the prompts in the library
and the players who are playing, as well as the round number and any points collected so far
* As a user, I want to be able to load a previously saved game, complete with players and prompts, 
rather than starting a new one
